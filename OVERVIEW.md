# Highlight Anywhere - Technical Overview

## Architecture Overview

The Highlight Anywhere extension is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind. It follows modern Chrome extension development practices using Manifest V3.

### Core Components

1. **Content Script (src/content/content.js)**
   - Runs in the context of web pages
   - Handles text selection and highlighting
   - Maintains state of highlighted content
   - Persists and retrieves highlights

2. **Background Service Worker (src/background/background.js)**
   - Manages extension state across the browser
   - Handles keyboard shortcuts
   - Communicates with content scripts
   - Manages cross-tab coordination

3. **Popup UI (src/popup/)**
   - Provides user interface for settings
   - Offers toggle controls
   - Shows current extension status
   - Allows configuration of storage location and highlight color

4. **Utility Modules (src/utils/)**
   - **highlighter.js**: Provides extensible highlighting capabilities
   - **storage.js**: Handles data persistence and retrieval

### Data Flow

1. User selects text on a webpage with highlight mode enabled
2. Content script creates a highlight element and wraps the selection
3. Highlight data is stored in Chrome's storage API
4. When revisiting the page, stored highlights are retrieved and applied

## Extensibility

The extension is designed to be extended in several ways:

### Support for Highlighting Different Elements

The architecture supports extending beyond text highlighting to include:

1. **Images**: Highlighting complete images or regions within images
2. **Tables**: Highlighting rows, columns, or specific cells
3. **Videos**: Highlighting frames or regions in videos
4. **Interactive Elements**: Highlighting interactive components like buttons or forms

This extensibility is facilitated by:
- The `BaseHighlighter` class that defines a common interface
- Type-specific highlighters (e.g., `TextHighlighter`, `ImageHighlighter`)
- A factory pattern for creating appropriate highlighter instances

### Storage and Sync Options

The current implementation uses Chrome's local storage API, but the architecture allows for:

1. **Different Storage Backends**: Adding support for cloud storage, custom servers, etc.
2. **Sync Across Devices**: Enabling highlight synchronization between devices
3. **Export/Import**: Adding functionality to export and import highlights

### UI and Interaction

The extension's UI is designed to be extended with:

1. **Additional Settings**: More configuration options for highlighting behavior
2. **Advanced Selection Tools**: Tools for more precise selection and highlighting
3. **Collaboration Features**: Sharing highlights with others
4. **Annotation Tools**: Adding notes and comments to highlights

## Implementation Details

### Highlighting Mechanism

The extension uses DOM manipulation to create highlights:
1. Wraps selected text in `<span>` elements with appropriate styling
2. Tracks highlight positions using node paths within the DOM
3. Reapplies highlights when revisiting pages by reconstructing the DOM paths

### Storage

Highlights are stored with:
1. A unique identifier
2. The URL of the page
3. The selected text content
4. Path information for DOM location
5. Start and end offsets within text nodes
6. Timestamp and other metadata

### User Experience

The extension provides several UX features:
1. Visual feedback when highlight mode is active via cursor changes
2. Color configuration for personal preference
3. Keyboard shortcut for quick toggling
4. Settings persistence across browser sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Highlight Categories**: Allow grouping highlights by purpose, project, etc.
2. **Search**: Search within highlights across all pages
3. **AI Integration**: Smart highlight suggestions based on content
4. **PDF Support**: Extend highlighting to PDF files viewed in the browser
5. **Performance Optimizations**: For pages with many highlights
6. **Backup and Restore**: More robust data preservation options

## Development Guidelines

When extending the extension:

1. Maintain the modular structure with clear separation of concerns
2. Follow the established patterns for new highlighter types
3. Keep the UI consistent with the Apple-inspired minimalist design
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing highlight data
5. Add comprehensive documentation for new features
